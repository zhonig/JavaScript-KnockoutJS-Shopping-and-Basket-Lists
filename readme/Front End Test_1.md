# untapt's Front End Tech Test

## The Grocery List App

I live with two roommates. We go grocery shopping together every other Tuesday. There are some items that we purchase every week – things like milk, cereal, and a selection of gourmet cheeses. In addition, each of us chooses a different recipe to make that we will eat together as part of a 'family meal.' Keeping track of all of these items is complicated – we need a tool to help us keep track of what to buy. Let's call it _Basket_.

_Basket_ should allow us to:

* Add items (i.e. _Strawberries_) and associated quantities (i.e. _3_) to a shopping list
* Mark items as 'in the basket'
* Clear 'in the basket' items from the list

_(Note: For the purposes of this exercise, it is safe to assume that all quantities are measured in integers. For example, it's okay to add "3 Corn" or "1 Milk". No need to worry about Cups or Pounds or Ears.)_

As a final step, you should add a feature to _Basket_ that will improve the usefulness of your application. It can be anything. Surprise us! (Hint: ideally, this feature also allows you to show off an interesting programming paradigm.)

_Basket_ should be functional and beautiful. Though this isn't a design test, we expect our front end engineers to have a great eye for design. With that said, remember that this is primarily an engineering role. As such, we are looking for solutions that emphasize javascript best practices, as well as the best practices of your front-end framework.


## Constraints and Recommendations

* You should use a modern client-side front-end web framework. We recommend Angular or React, but you can use whatever you are most comfortable in. If you use a less common framework, be prepared to explain how it works.
* You may use transcompiling languages like CoffeeScript or ClojureScript, but you should only do so if you take advantage of language features not available in vanilla javascript. Again, be prepared to explain anything not written in vanilla javascript.
* Your styles should be written in SASS or LESS unless you have a compelling reason to use 1) a different preprocessor or 2) no preprocessor.
* Feel free to use a combination of NPM/Bower/Grunt/Gulp/whatever to get your up and running, but keep in mind that the focus of this exercise is your app, not the environment. 
* Please do not use scaffolding tools like Yeoman. 
* You should include instructions for how to run your app in a README file. 
* Use git.


## Constraints

We don't expect you to spend more than about two hours on this test. We'd rather see a beautiful partial implementation than a hacked-together-but-complete solution. If you have any questions or find anything to be ambiguous, please do reach out to us and ask. 


## Delivering _Basket_

You have two options for delivery:

1. Upload to a public Github repository and email us the link
1. Send us a Dropbox or Google Drive link to a Zip file containing your git repo
